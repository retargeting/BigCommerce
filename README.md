### Installing Retargeting Application
As Bigcommerce doesn't allow applications to add JS snippets in shops, every client needs to add the snippets manually. It's pretty easy, you'll just have to follow the wizard.

To run the wizzard just click "Run" under the "Wizard" title and follow the steps shown there.
> *Keep in mind that after changing some settings in our Application's configuration page, it is necessary to go through these steps again, to ensure the proper functionality of our application.*

### Configuration
